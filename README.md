The utility tool for your browser to keep you out of distracting sites when visiting them would be useless or there is nothing new on the site and hence saves your time! Currently integrated with twitter.com, the chrome extension asks you to give a second thought whether to save yourselves some time if there's nothing new on the website to view.


**Prerequisites:**
---
Google Chrome - That's just it!


**Installing:**
---
Just load the extension onto yur chrome and you're good to go!


**Execution:**
---
The app runs in the background and is integrated with your twitter account. The app keeps a track of new notifications coming to you through twitter. So, if you're in front of your computer and and the inner you urges to get some time wasted by visiting some time consuming, un-fruitful site (twitter at the moment) what the extension does is it checks whether you have a new notification or not, if you do, well visiting the site may be worth it and hence, it doesn't stops you from doing so, but if your account doesn't has anything new, what the app does is, it goes to your history and searches for MORE PRODUCTIVE sites and makes a decision and then redirects you to one of them based on the decision algorithm.

**Deployment:**
---

After adding as a chrome extension, visit the sites (currently https://twitter.com/), and let the app decide for the sake of your time.
Request us for more websites and we'ld add them too.
